<h3>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a 2002 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games as part of the Grand Theft Auto series. Set in 1986 within the fictional Vice City, based on Miami, the game follows the exploits of mobster Tommy Vercetti after his release from prison. Upon being caught up in an ambushed drug deal, he seeks out those responsible while slowly building a criminal empire and seizing power from other criminal organisations in the city.</h3>
<h4>The game is played from a third-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam Vice City, consisting of two main islands. The game's plot is based on multiple real-world people and events in Miami such as Cubans, Haitians, and biker gangs, the 1980s crack epidemic, the Mafioso drug lords of Miami, and the dominance of glam metal. The game was also influenced by the film and television of the era, including Scarface and Miami Vice. Much of the development work constituted creating the game world to fit the inspiration and time period; the development team conducted extensive field research in Miami while creating the world. The game was released in October 2002 for the PlayStation 2, in May 2003 for Microsoft Windows, and in October 2003 for the Xbox.</h4>
